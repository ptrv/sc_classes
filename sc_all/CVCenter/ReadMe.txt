CVCenter is a class-extension for the SuperCollider programming-environment which allows you to easily use MIDI-controllers within a Pattern-sequencing-structure.

INSTALLATION

On Mac OS X put all content of this folder into 

~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/

(you may create your own folder e.g. named "CVCenter" in Extensions).

Additionally you must have the Conductor-Quark installed. Quarks are a mechanism for extending SuperCollider by external libraries. If you have set up SuperCollider properly you should be able to install the Conductor-Quark within SuperCollider in the following way:

Quarks.checkout("Conductor)

Then hit cmd+k to recompile your library.

For more information refer to the Quarks-helpfile or see the SuperCollider online-documentation at http://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/supercollider/trunk/build/Help/Help.html

Good luck + have fun!
